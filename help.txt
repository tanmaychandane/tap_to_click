This is just a quick fix for enabling tap to click functionality to your Desktop.
For using this, your system needs to have "xserver-xorg-input-synaptics" package installed. If your system dosen't have one installed, it can be done typing following command in your favourite Debian based Linux distribution like Debian, Ubuntu, KDE neon, etc.

sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics

Once the package is installed, execute following command in terminal.
synclient TapButton1=1 TapButton2=3 TapButton3=2

For adding scrolling functionality
synclient TapButton1=1 TapButton2=3 TapButton3=2 VertEdgeScroll=1


Operating System used for testing: Ubuntu Mate with Openbox windowmanager
If you are an openbox user like me, just paste the following command in your autostart configuration, so you don't need to execute it every time you login to the WM.
